# Maze Solver with DFS and BFS Algorithms

This project is based on my project in the artificial intelligence course I took during Erasmus. The aim is to simulate the maze given in the text with DFS and BFS algorithms and compare the two different algorithms.  


## Tech Stack

While performing the algorithm using C# within the project, I used unity to simulate the project.
